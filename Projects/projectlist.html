            <h3><a href="project1.html">Satellite Tracking and Trajectory Prediction Application</a></h3>
            <p>Developed an innovative web application to enhance Space Situational Awareness (SSA) by providing real-time 
               satellite tracking and trajectory prediction for Earthâ€™s orbit. The application leverages open-source Two-Line Element (TLE) data 
               and integrates both traditional mathematical models and an experimental Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model 
               for precise satellite trajectory prediction.</p>

            <h3>Earth Rock Classifier</h3>
            <p>Developed a RaspberryPi 4B based ML model that identifies 35 different types of rocks. This project was 
               developed to understand and learn about image processing and learn how to integrate Machine Learning in Embedded systems.</p>
